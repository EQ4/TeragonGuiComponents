* This class is a simple subclass of the Juce Label class, with the only
* difference being that it ellipsizes long text (ie, adding "…" to the end
* of long strings which must be truncated. Juce also ellipsizes, but it
* first tries to compact the text by decreasing the width, which looks
* quite bad. Also, Juce does not use the UTF-8 ellipsis character, instead
* using "...", which takes up much more space.
