/**
* Provides a two-line status window for displaying parameter information.
* To use this widget, you must call subscribeToParameters() after all other
* GUI widgets have been constructed. That method will iterate over all
* parameters in the ThreadsafePluginParameterSet, finding those which have
* at least one TeragonGuiComponent registered as an observer. Any updates
* on those parameters will be automatically displayed in this component.
*
* This widget is necessary because of the minimalist style of the other GUI
* widgets. Rather than cluttering up the entire UI with unit labels, or
* using tooltips to display plugin values, this component is used instead.
*
* For components which can receive mouse-over events, this widget will
* register itself as an observer there as well so that the current parameter
* value can be shown without having to alter the value.
